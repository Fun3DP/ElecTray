This is a personal project I’ve been working on for a while during my first Voron 2.4 build. I also have a heavily modified Sidewinder X2 printer, where easy access to electronics was my top priority during upgrades. With that in mind, I took the same approach when working on my Voron 2.4. This modification has already proven to be highly useful and convenient, as it has allowed me to quickly access and rectify certain issues as they arise.

## STL
I have modified the necessary models, such as the skirting, to ensure they fit the modification properly. Additionally, I have designed and created new models as needed to facilitate the project's progress. These include an adapter for the Manta M8P board, slightly modified WAGO shelves to better suit the updated design, and a refined BTT HDMI 5" mount for improved compatibility (source...). Each modification was made to enhance functionality, optimize integration, and ensure seamless assembly within the updated setup<br>

## CAD
<table>
<tr>
<td>
I have created a CAD model for reference purposes only, allowing you to understand its construction, visualize its design, and see how it functions. While it is not intended for direct use, it provides a detailed overview of the mod’s structure and mechanics
